# Telecom Customer Churn Data Science Project

## Introduction
This data science project is based on the customer churn data of a fictional telecom company. The company has been losing a good number of customers for some time and is eager to find the reason behind it. The data provided consists of **39 columns & 7043 rows**. This dataset holds information like customer demographics, serives availed by each customer, billing data, churn status & resons behind churn. I have applied my data analysis as well as data science skills to answer few questions and build an ML model that can classify whether a customer will leave the company or not.

This project has also been completed using Power BI. Power BI dashboard consists of two pages, **Customer Demographics** and **Customer Churn**. 
- Customer Demographics page brings insights about the customers, distribution by gender, distribution by age group, a map showing the density of customers based on their geographical location & a table showing the high value customers.
- Customer Churn page throws light onto the business relates insights telling the key driver of the customer churn, customer churn by revenue per customer, contract type, service type, and a line chart showing the churn count by services used.
- The dashbaord also consists of a side navigation menu to navigate to different pages and clear all selected filters at once.
