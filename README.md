# Telecom Customer Churn Data Science Project

## Introduction
This data science project is based on the customer churn data of a fictional telecom company. The company has been losing a good number of customers for some time and is eager to find the reason behind it. The data provided consists of **39 columns & 7043 rows**. This dataset holds information like customer demographics, serives availed by each customer, billing data, churn status & resons behind churn. I have applied my data analysis as well as data science skills to answer few questions and build an ML model that can classify whether a customer will leave the company or not.
